ABSTRACT = {Designing a controller is typically an iterative process during which engineers must assess the performance of a design through time-consuming simulations; this becomes even more burdensome when using a population-based metaheuristic that evaluates every member of the population. Distributed algorithms can mitigate this issue, but these come with their own challenges. This is why, in this work, we propose a distributed and asynchronous bio-inspired algorithm to execute the simulations in parallel, using a multi-population multi-algorithmic approach. Following a cloud-native pattern, isolated populations interact asynchronously using a distributed message queue, which avoids idle cycles when waiting for other nodes to synchronize. The proposed algorithm can mix different metaheuristics, one for each population, first because it is possible and second because it can help keep total diversity high. To validate the speedup benefit of our proposal, we optimize the membership functions of a fuzzy controller for the trajectory tracking of a mobile autonomous robot using distributed versions of genetic algorithms, particle swarm optimization, and a mixed-metaheuristic configuration. We compare sequential versus distributed implementations and demonstrate the benefits of mixing the populations with distinct metaheuristics. We also propose a simple migration strategy that delivers satisfactory results. Moreover, we compare homogeneous and heterogenous configurations for the populations&rsquo; parameters. The results show that even when we use random heterogeneous parameter configuration in the distributed populations, we obtain an error similar to that in other work while significantly reducing the execution time.},

abstract = "Scientific workflows consisting of a high number of interdependent tasks represent an important class of complex scientific applications. Recently, a new type of serverless infrastructures has emerged, represented by such services as Google Cloud Functions and AWS Lambda, also referred to as the Function-as-a-Service model. In this paper we take a look at such serverless infrastructures, which are designed mainly for processing background tasks of Web and Internet of Things applications, or event-driven stream processing. We evaluate their applicability to more compute- and data-intensive scientific workflows and discuss possible ways to repurpose serverless architectures for execution of scientific workflows. We have developed prototype workflow executor functions using AWS Lambda and Google Cloud Functions, coupled with the HyperFlow workflow engine. These functions can run workflow tasks in AWS and Google infrastructures, and feature such capabilities as data staging to/from S3 or Google Cloud Storage and execution of custom application binaries. We have successfully deployed and executed the Montage astronomy workflow, often used as a benchmark, and we report on initial results of its performance evaluation. Our findings indicate that the simple mode of operation makes this approach easy to use, although there are costs involved in preparing portable application binaries for execution in a remote environment. While our solution is an early prototype, we find the presented approach highly promising. We also discuss possible future steps related to execution of scientific workflows in serverless infrastructures. Finally, we perform a cost analysis and discuss implications with regard to resource management for scientific applications in general."

	abstract = {In this work, we propose, through the use of population-based metaheuristics, an optimization method that solves the problem of autonomous path tracking using a rear-wheel fuzzy logic controller. This approach enables the design of controllers using rules that are linguistically familiar to human users. Moreover, a new technique that uses three different paths to validate the performance of each candidate configuration is presented. We extend on our previous work by adding two more membership functions to the previous fuzzy model, intending to have a finer-grained adjustment. We tuned the controller using several well-known metaheuristic methods, Genetic Algorithms (GA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO), Harmony Search (HS), and the recent Aquila Optimizer (AO) and Arithmetic Optimization Algorithms. Experiments validate that, compared to published results, the proposed fuzzy controllers have better RMSE-measured performance. Nevertheless, experiments also highlight problems with the common practice of evaluating the performance of fuzzy controllers with a single problem case and performance metric, resulting in controllers that tend to be overtrained.},

	abstract = {Optimization problems are present in many fields of science, engineering, and industry. In most cases, optimization problems involve a large number of complex decision variables. Often, the application of fuzzy systems to traditional control strategies requires the use of optimization techniques to define the parameters of the membership functions capturing the designer's experience. Currently, bioinspired algorithms are one of the most widely used methods for fuzzy system optimization. In this paper, we review the literature on the application of different bioinspired techniques such as Genetic Algorithms, Ant Colony Optimization, Particle Swarm Optimization, Galaxy Swarm Optimization, Harmony Search, Firefly, Differential Evolution, to optimize the parameters of the fuzzy controllers. We found particular trends in the current literature, with many methods using dynamic parameter adaptation, hybrids, distributed algorithms, and type-2 fuzzy logic.},

@inproceedings{mancilla2022tracking,
	abstract = {This paper presents three configurations for evolving the membership functions' parameters for a path-following fuzzy controller. Designers of fuzzy controllers have many options when selecting which parameters and how the optimization algorithm adjusts them. The experiments obtained excellent results with a relatively simple controller using three membership for each of the variables. We tested the proposed controller by a robot simulation that follows a path using a rear-wheel tracking technique. We optimized the controller's parameters using a genetic algorithm that consisted of a population of chromosomes containing the parameters of a controller. Each individual's fitness in the populations was determined by calculating the root-mean-square error resulting from each simulation. We have observed, changes in the selection of parameters that parameters to optimize, we tested four, eight, and 18, affect the results obtained and are essentialto minimize the total time of evaluations and a minimum possible error. We also tested two ranges for the random values used for initializing the population and verify that this selection also impacts the algorithms' performance.},

	abstract = {Symmetries play very important in the dynamics of robot systems. The relevant control of robot arm motion with fault diagnosis including the optimized fuzzy algorithm based on the error rate adjustment P, I, D value (Fuzzy PID algorithm) model relies on symmetry principles. A robot is a kind of mechanical device that can program and perform certain operations and mobile tasks under automatic control. The manipulator is a very complex multi-input multi-output non-linear system and the main actuator of the robot. This paper focuses on the design of a control algorithm for a two-degree-of-freedom (2-DOF) manipulator. First, the mathematical model of a 2-DOF articulated manipulator is established, that is, the functional relationship between the input driving force vector and the output rotation angle vector of a 2-DOF manipulator. Then, a set of trajectory planning algorithms are designed by using gradient model control, which can calculate the trajectory of the end-effector of a 2-DOF manipulator according to the user's task requirements. The experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},
